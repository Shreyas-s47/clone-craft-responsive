      question: "Do you cover the cost of return shipping?",
      answer: "No â€” Baccksee does not cover the cost of your return shipping. You must either provide a prepaid label or ensure the return cost is handled by the retailer. If no label is available, we can still help pack and drop off your item, but you'll be responsible for any return fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you return anything I give you?",
      answer: "Not everything is eligible for return. Before scheduling a pickup, please check your retailer's return policy and item eligibility. We can handle most returns, but items must meet the return criteria of the store or brand you purchased from."
    },
    {
      question: "How far in advance should I book a pickup?",
      answer: "We recommend booking your pickup at least 24-48 hours in advance to ensure availability. However, we often accommodate same-day or next-day pickups depending on demand in your area."
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do you service?",
      answer: "We currently provide service across Canada in major urban areas. Contact us to confirm if we service your specific location and to check pickup availability in your neighborhood."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my return is rejected?",
      answer: "If a return is rejected by the retailer, we'll contact you immediately to discuss options. This could include returning the item to you or helping you contact the retailer to resolve any issues."
